# A digital audio workstation (DAW) Web App for Collaboration

### Pitch
Imagine being able to create music with your friends or with anyone in the world online. As long as your instrument (or mic) connects to the PC, you can truly collaborate with no software and project setup required. No prior experience in music production is required.

### Vision
The music app meant for musicians to come together and quickly create something new
